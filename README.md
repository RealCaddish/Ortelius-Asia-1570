# Ortelius-Asia-1570

##This project is a  guided tour of Abraham Ortelius' <i> Asiae noua descriptio: </i> 

Check out the map at the Boston Public Library's https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:st74cw485 which houses this map of Asia by Dutch cartographer, Abraham Ortelius.


I wanted to make this map as an opportunity in search of historic events in 1570 when it was commissioned and later published by <i> Gilles Coppens de Diest at Antwer </i> during the prescribed <b> Golden Age of Netherlandish Cartography</b> in 1570. This project lends itself to examining Dutch relations around southeast Asia and Ottoman Arabia through  different nations and regions depicted on Ortelius' map. 

Who was the Wanli Emperor of China during the Ming Dynasty? Which natural landforms serve as political borders across the region? By examining this map as a constrained encyclopedia in time and place, I hope that the viewer can be situated in a more dynamic, digital, and historical context. Traditional and analogue teaching methods of historiography are often considered static and detached which makes them challenging for the reader to absorb.
