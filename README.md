# Ortelius-Asia-1570
A guided tour of Abraham Ortelius' &lt;i>Asiae noua descriptio.&lt;/i> I wanted to make this map as an opportunity to look at historic events in 1570 when it was commissioned and later published by &lt;i>Gilles Coppens de Diest at Antwerp&lt;/i> . This project lends itself towards examining Dutch relations around southeast Asia and the Saudi Peninsula by guiding the viewer to different nations and regions on the map.
