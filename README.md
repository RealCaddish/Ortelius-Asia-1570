##This project is a  guided tour of Abraham Ortelius' <i> Asiae noua descriptio: </i> 

Check out this 1570 atlas at the Boston Public Library's Leventhal Map Center, housing this map of Asia by Dutch cartographer, Abraham Ortelius:

I wanted to make this map as an opportunity in search of historic events in 1570 when it was orginally commissioned and published by <i> Gilles Coppens de Diest at Antwer </i> during the prescribed <b> Golden Age of Netherlandish Cartography.</b> This project lends itself to examining Dutch relations around southeast Asia and Ottoman Arabia through  different nations and regions depicted on Ortelius' map. 

Who was the Wanli Emperor of China during the Ming Dynasty? Which natural landforms serve as political borders across the region? By examining this map as a constrained encyclopedia in time and place, I hope that the viewer can be situated in a refreshing historical context that's both more dynamic and interactive than traditional analogue  methods of historic 'story-telling.'
